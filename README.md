# Ansible Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and roles for configuring and managing servers. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.x
- Python 2.7 or higher

## Structure

```
.
├── inventory
├── playbooks
├── roles
└── ansible.cfg
```

- `inventory`: This directory contains the inventory file that lists the hosts to be managed by Ansible.
- `playbooks`: This directory contains the main playbooks.
- `roles`: This directory contains the roles. Each role is a set of tasks, handlers, and variables that can be used in multiple playbooks.
- `ansible.cfg`: This is the configuration file for Ansible.

## How to use

1. Install Ansible on your local machine. See the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for installation instructions.

2. Update the `inventory` file with the IP addresses of the hosts you want to manage.

3. Update the `playbooks` and `roles` according to your needs.

4. Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command. For example:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/main.yml
```
